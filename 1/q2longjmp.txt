2b.)

i.)
The output which is different is the number of times in which the destructor was called. 
In the case of try/catch the stack must be walked to check for a corresponding catch block 
and have the destructors called for the struct T object. In the case of the setjmp/longjmp
a direct-nonlocal transfer occurs and the stack is not unwound, thus the destructors are not called 

ii.) 

O0:

q2throwcatch: 7.,72u
q2longjmp: 1.76u

O2: 
q2throwcatch: 7.16u

q2longjmp: 1.50u


iii.) 
The original is over 4 times as slow for the origianl program as compared to the 
modified program using jumps. This is due to the O(n) walk of the stack in the original case 
due to the need to find the topmost corresponding catch block when an exception is thrown 
as well as the need to call possible destructors for each stack frame. In the modified program 
a direct non-local transfer is made and no walk of the stack needs to be done. 

iv.)
With compiler optimizations both programs exhibit better performance, however the 
magnitude difference between the original and altered program stays about the same.
